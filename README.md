# Machine Vision Coursework ‚Äì MATLAB Implementation

This repository contains the full implementation of a machine vision coursework project completed as part of the module at the University of Sheffield (2024‚Äì25). It includes various image processing, video analysis, robotics, and CNN-based classification tasks implemented in MATLAB.

## üìÅ Project Structure
- `Task1_Histogram_EdgeDetection`: RGB histogram analysis and edge detection using Sobel, Prewitt, and Canny operators.
- `Task2_OpticalFlow_Trajectory`: Lucas-Kanade optical flow, motion tracking, and trajectory analysis with RMSE.
- `Task3_MotionDetection`: Frame differencing and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based foreground detection in traffic videos.
- `Task4_RobotTreasureHunt`: Visual pathfinding using color and arrow detection in simulated treasure maps.
- `Task5_CNN_ImageClassification`: Transfer learning with GoogleNet for image classification, with precision/recall/F1 analysis.

## üîß Technologies Used
- MATLAB (Image Processing Toolbox, Computer Vision Toolbox, Deep Learning Toolbox)
- GoogleNet (transfer learning)
- Traditional image processing algorithms (edge detection, optical flow, background subtraction)

## üß† Key Highlights
- Achieved 96%+ classification accuracy using CNN improvements.
- Applied robust optical flow tracking with an RMSE of just 0.96 pixels.
- Developed a recursive visual pathfinding algorithm for robot navigation.
- Evaluated motion detection techniques in real-world traffic footage.
